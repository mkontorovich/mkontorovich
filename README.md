### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mikhail, but I prefer either Mike or MK.

I'm a self-taught front-end developer and automation engineer. 
<br>Most of my career has been in QA, but I'm working towards becoming a full-stack developer.
<br>I have a passion for good design, elegant code, and strong coffee.
<br>ðŸ“« You can reach me at: mikhail.kontorovich@gmail.com
<br>âš¡ Fun fact: I watched Fellowship of the Ring everyday one year in college. I used to be able to act out the entire movie word for word.
