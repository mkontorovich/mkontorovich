### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mikhail, but I prefer either Mike or MK.

I'm a self-taught front-end developer and automation engineer. 
<br>I have a passion for good design, elegant code, and strong coffee.
<br>ðŸ“« You can reach me at: mikhail.kontorovich@gmail.com
<br>âš¡ Fun fact: I watched Fellowship of the Ring everyday for one full year in college. It was worth it.

This will be where the code of my portfolio will go. Currently a work in progress.
